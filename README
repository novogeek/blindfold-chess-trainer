This is a Chess training tool which assists in learning the art of playing chess blindfolded!
(To play chess blindfolded, you need to know Chess notation and should be able to quickly point out the color of the square given a square name.
e.g., the first square on the left is a1 and its color is black. Moving rightside the squares are b1, c1...h1
Moving to the top from a1, you have a2, a3...a8).

I developed it about 3 years back for helping kids learn blind fold chess at CyberChess Academy. 
I thought I lost this code due to system crash sometime back but glad that I found it all of a sudden.
Now it's permanent at Github. YaY! 

By the way, it was developed very quickly with my limited knowledge of JS/jQuery at that time, but it works great.
Now I'm too busy to improve the code w.r.t performance, proper JS/CSS guidelines etc.
Please contribute if you can so that kids will get huge benefit! Seriously!!
